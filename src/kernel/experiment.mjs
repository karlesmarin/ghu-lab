 * WHY A FILE OF NUMBERS HAS A HEADER.  A value quoted from memory is a value nobody can check,
 * and a value without a date is a value that will be stale without anybody noticing.  Every entry
 * here carries WHERE it was read and WHEN, and the harness refuses an entry without either.  The
 * numbers were read from the sources on 2026-09-03; a reader who finds a newer edition should
 * change the entry and the date together.
 *
 * WHAT THESE ARE FOR.  A 5D model at its vacuum is dimensionless until one mass is measured:
 * the Wilson-line angle fixes m_W·R, and m_W then fixes 1/R and, through the ladder, every other
 * mass in GeV.  That is the confrontation `vac5Confront` performs, and these are its inputs.
 * Bounds are quoted for the signature they were set on — a dijet limit on a colour-octet vector
 * applies to the first KK level of the gluon ONLY if colour lives in the bulk — and the page
 * says which hypothesis each verdict rests on rather than applying a bound to a state it was not
 * set for.
